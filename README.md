Autonomous vehicles want reliable and strong sensor suites and alert systems. This proposed system
discuss the composition and performance of a sophisticated monitoring and alert system for automobile
vehicle parameters. The number of automobiles has also grown quickly to meet the enormous population. Additionally, this resulted in an increase in accidents. The accident prevention strategies now in use are
all static and dated. Additionally, there is no reliable accident detection system. Automobile vehicle
parameters are continuously monitored by a micro-controller which stores the data logs containing
vehicle parameter data into a sheltered digital memory card and in the cloud storage. The system doesnâ€™t
solely record the vehicle parameters data of the automobile periodically, but also actively monitors for
any sudden vehicle accident detection. The sensor may facilitate folks to analyze the accident quickly
and lawfully when a collision happens to alert the emergency services to that location. The system will
update the information whenever an abnormal system event happens. A black box in a vehicle gather
driving information about the vehicle before, during and after a crash. Important data, such as the
temperature of the engine, vibrations, and alcohol consumption of the driver, are locally saved and
obtained from all the data via the IoT.
